# Google Apps Script Modifications

## Overview
This document outlines the modifications made to the Google Apps Script used in conjunction with the Vue.js application for managing delivery and check-in processes. The application is designed to facilitate efficient delivery management, check-in processes, and invoice handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Error Handling Enhancements
- **Files Affected**: `src/services/api.js`
- **Description**: Improved error handling in API functions to provide user-friendly alerts instead of console logs. Each API function now alerts the user when an error occurs, guiding them to retry the action. This change enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback on issues encountered during API calls.
- **Example**: 
  - In `fetchBranchConfig`, if an error occurs, the user will see an alert: "Gagal memuat data cabang. Silakan coba lagi."

### 2. Date Formatting
- **Files Affected**: `src/App.vue`
- **Description**: Updated the `formatDateTime` function to ensure it returns the correct format for `datetime-local` inputs. This is essential for user input consistency and ensures that the date is formatted correctly for submission.
- **New Format**: The function now returns the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`.

### 3. Component Reviews
- **Files Affected**: `src/views/CheckinView.vue`, `src/views/DeliveryView.vue`, `src/views/ExpensesView.vue`, `src/views/ProfileView.vue`
- **Description**: Conducted thorough reviews of all components and views to ensure they adhere to best practices and provide a cohesive user experience. This includes checking for dynamic class bindings, form validation, and error handling.

## Future Considerations
- Implement the actual functionality for the `ExpensesView` and `ProfileView` components to enhance the application's capabilities.
- Ensure that all user feedback mechanisms are in place for a better user experience, including inline error messages and success notifications.

## Conclusion
These modifications aim to enhance the usability and reliability of the application, ensuring that users have a smooth experience when managing deliveries and check-ins. The focus on user-friendly error handling and consistent date formatting will contribute to a more robust application.
